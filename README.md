2. Navigate to **Pages** section
3. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions** as the build and deployment method
4. That's it! Your site will be available at `https://journeyto0.github.io/XpenseWise/`

### Adding Your Files

Simply add your HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other static files to the repository:

- Replace or modify `index.html` with your expense tracking application

All files in the repository root will be deployed to GitHub Pages automatically when you push to the main branch.
